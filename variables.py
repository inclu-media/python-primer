Here python-primer has problems: age is an integer and the plus operator could either mean adding
the number or concatenating them.
There are two possible solutions:
'''
print("My name is " + name + " and I am " + str(age) + " years old.")  # concatenation -> ok
print("My name is %s and I am %d years old" % (name, age))  # interpolation -> better

# Capturing variables
